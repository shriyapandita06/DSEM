Exploring the QS World University RankingsÂ® 2023 based on 8 key ranking indicators with understanding the data, feature selection, and modeling it along with model interpretability.
The different notebooks performing the below are published above.

Aim:
Create Dataset and perform Data Cleaning and Feature Selection
Create AutoML library like H2O.ai to create predictive models and interpret them
Interpret the results of : Linear Model, Tree Based Model, Best model of AutoML H2O
Using different Model Interpretibility Methods : SHAP analysis, LIME analysis, Partial Dependence Plot Analysis
